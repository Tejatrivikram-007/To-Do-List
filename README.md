# To-Do List Web Application

This project is a **To-Do List Web Application** built using **Python**, **Django**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The app allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, and deleting tasks. Each user has a personalized task list, where they can track and manage their daily activities.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their own task lists.
- **Task Management**: Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks from their list.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Specific Task Lists**: Each user has their own task list, and tasks are displayed according to the authenticated user.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The backend is built using Python.
- **Django**: The web framework used to manage the application, handle user authentication, and render dynamic content.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Used for creating the structure and styling of the frontend.
- **SQLite**: Default database used to store user information and tasks (can be changed to any other database system like PostgreSQL).
- **Bootstrap (optional)**: For faster and responsive design styling (if added).

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list.git
cd to-do-list
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

**For Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies
Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run database migrations
Before starting the server, you need to apply the database migrations to set up the models.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a superuser (optional)
You can create a superuser to log into the Django admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 7. Run the development server
Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 8. Visit the website
Once the server is running, open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the To-Do List web application.

### Example Features:

#### 1. **Task Management:**
   Users can add tasks with a name and description. Each task can be marked as completed or deleted.

   Example model in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Task(models.Model):
       user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
       description = models.TextField()
       completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
       created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

       def __str__(self):
           return self.name
   ```

#### 2. **User Authentication:**
   - Users must sign up or log in to view and manage their task lists.
   - Authentication is managed using Django’s built-in authentication system.
   
#### 3. **Task Views:**
   Views for adding, updating, and deleting tasks will be managed in `views.py`.

   Example view:
   ```python
   @login_required
   def task_list(request):
       tasks = Task.objects.filter(user=request.user)
       return render(request, 'task_list.html', {'tasks': tasks})

   @login_required
   def add_task(request):
       if request.method == 'POST':
           name = request.POST['name']
           description = request.POST['description']
           Task.objects.create(name=name, description=description, user=request.user)
           return redirect('task_list')
       return render(request, 'add_task.html')
   ```

#### 4. **Styling:**
   Use **HTML** and **CSS** for designing a clean, user-friendly interface.

   Example `styles.css`:
   ```css
   body {
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
       background-color: #f4f4f4;
       color: #333;
   }

   .task-list {
       width: 60%;
       margin: 0 auto;
       padding: 20px;
       background-color: white;
       box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
   }

   .task-item {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: space-between;
       padding: 10px;
       border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
   }

   .task-item button {
       background-color: #dc3545;
       color: white;
       border: none;
       padding: 5px 10px;
       cursor: pointer;
   }

   .task-item button:hover {
       background-color: #c82333;
   }
   ```
